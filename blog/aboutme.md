---

My name is Ryadh Dahimene, I'm a consulting architect working for a search focused company called Elastic (the makers of Elasticsearch).

Prior to that, I've held various positions in consulting, management and academic research. I hold a PhD degree from the *Conservatoire National des Arts et MÃ©tiers* where I had the chance to work on social networks data analysis, recommender systems and scalability. My main [page](http://www.ryadh.net) holds more details about my work.
